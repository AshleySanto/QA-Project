**_How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?_**

The best way I can ensure that my code is functional and secure is by making sure I'm using proper naming and syntax to make sure there are no bugs or defects that could cause issues or be exploited. The next thing is to test often to make sure bugs are caught when working on smaller portions versus waiting until the end and having a bigger mess. Then, there's making sure to make sure any input is being validated, paying attention to warnings, and making sure there are no holes in the code that an unauthorized source could gain access to.

**_How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?_**

The best way to interpret user needs is to find out directly from the users what they are looking for. This could be anything from functional elements they want to see to designs that make it better for their usage. Once finding out what the most important needs are for them, we would turn them into user stories or use cases that the team can use to know what needs to be incorporated into the program.

**_How do I approach designing software?_**

The way I like to approach designing software is to break it down step by step. After figuring out what the client wants to incorporate, the next thing I like to do is figure out the requirements and how to implement them. Then, I work through each element, coding and testing them along the way until I get to the finished program.
